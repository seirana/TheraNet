>>> Flowcharts explain the steps of the method.

>>> To run this code, you need a list of disease target genes with Ensembl IDs in numerical format. 
  To obtain such data, remove the first four letters ('ENSG') from the Ensembl gene IDs, name the column 'ENSEMBL ID', and store the data as a .csv file. 
  There is a file named disease_target_genes.csv. You can use it as a sample.
